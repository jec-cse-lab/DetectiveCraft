### Rules of DetectiveCraft
The first click will never be a mine. It will clear the map and place numbers on the grid. The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
DetectiveCraft is a single-player puzzle game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or "x"s without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
